## **üéØ Project Highlights**

- Built a hybrid model combining GCN embeddings with XGBoost to predict both ADHD diagnosis and biological sex using fMRI brain imaging data and metadata  
- Achieved **84% accuracy for ADHD** and **97% accuracy for Sex_F** on validation set  
- Utilized a custom Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to extract embeddings from functional connectivity matrices (FCMs)  
- Performed hyperparameter tuning via `RandomizedSearchCV` with 5-fold cross-validation

## **üèóÔ∏è Project Overview**

This project was developed as part of the **Spring 2025 Break Through Tech AI Studio** and submitted to the **WiDS Datathon 2025** on Kaggle.  
We were tasked with building a model that uses **fMRI data** to predict:

1. ADHD diagnosis (binary)
2. Biological sex (binary)

The model supports neuroscience research by identifying **functional connectome patterns**, particularly those affecting underrepresented groups such as females with ADHD.

## **üìä Data Exploration**

**Dataset Sources:**
- Functional Connectivity Matrices (FCMs)
- Quantitative & Categorical Metadata
- ADHD & Sex_F Labels

**Exploration Highlights:**
- Visualized distributions for ADHD and Sex_F classes
- Noted **class imbalance** in ADHD cases, especially among females
- Merged data across all training sources
- Detected and imputed missing values
- Standardized numeric features and encoded categorical ones

**Challenges:**
- High dimensionality (19,901 FCM features)
- Multi-output task
- Imbalanced target labels

---

## **üß† Model Development**

### Graph Convolutional Network (GCN):
- Built with **PyTorch Geometric**
- Extracted graph-based embeddings from fMRI FCMs

### XGBoost Classifier:
- Trained separately for **ADHD_Outcome** and **Sex_F**
- Wrapped in `MultiOutputClassifier`
- Applied `scale_pos_weight` to balance ADHD classes

### Pipeline:
- Preprocessing via `ColumnTransformer`
- Grid tuning with `RandomizedSearchCV` over 5 folds
- Best CV score: **0.614**

## **üìà Results & Key Findings**

| Target        | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score | ROC-AUC |
|---------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| ADHD_Outcome  | 83.5%    | 80.7%     | 100%   | 89.3%    | 0.999   |
| Sex_F         | 96.7%    | 91.2%     | 100%   | 95.4%    | 0.998   |

- **Strong predictive performance**, especially for sex classification  
- Confusion matrices and ROC curves confirm robust discrimination  
- Multi-output classification architecture proved effective on this biomedical task

## **üñºÔ∏è Impact Narrative**

**What brain activity patterns are associated with ADHD? Are they different between males and females?**  
Using GCNs on FCMs allowed us to learn **graph-based embeddings** that captured nuanced ADHD-related brain connectivity patterns. Our results suggest **detectable differences** across sex-based subgroups, indicating unique neural signatures for ADHD in females.

**How could your work help ADHD research or clinical care?**  
By enabling **early detection** of ADHD via noninvasive imaging data, such models can assist clinicians in identifying cases that may otherwise be overlooked ‚Äî particularly among **female populations**, where underdiagnosis is common.

## **üöÄ Next Steps & Future Improvements**

- Expand the GCN with deeper layers or **attention mechanisms**
- Incorporate **temporal dynamics** from time-series fMRI (if available)
- Address overfitting via **dropout**, **data augmentation**, or **regularization**
- Evaluate **model fairness** and test **adversarial debiasing techniques**
