## **üèóÔ∏è Project Overview**

This project was completed as part of the Spring 2025 Break Through Tech AI Studio and submitted to the WiDS Datathon 2025 Kaggle competition.
We were challenged to build a machine learning model using fMRI data to predict two outputs: a person‚Äôs biological sex and whether they have ADHD. This work supports ongoing neuroscience research by identifying patterns in brain activity associated with ADHD, especially in female subjects.

* How your model performed overall
* How your model performed across different skin tones (AJL)
* Insights from evaluating model fairness (AJL)

**Potential visualizations to include:**

* Confusion matrix, precision-recall curve, feature importance plot, prediction distribution, outputs from fairness or explainability tools

## **üñºÔ∏è Impact Narrative**

What brain activity patterns are associated with ADHD; are they different between males and females?
 Using a GNN on functional connectivity matrices, we learned graph embeddings that helped capture ADHD-specific neural patterns. The classifier's performance suggests there are detectable and distinct patterns in how ADHD manifests across sexes.


How could your work help ADHD research or clinical care?
 With early prediction capability, such models could support screening and personalized treatment planning, reducing misdiagnoses and improving care especially for underrepresented groups like females with ADHD.

## **üöÄ Next Steps & Future Improvements**

Expand GNN architecture with deeper layers and attention mechanisms


Incorporate time-series dynamics from fMRI (if available)


Address overfitting by using data augmentation or dropout regularization


Apply fairness metrics and adversarial debiasing techniques to enhance model equity
